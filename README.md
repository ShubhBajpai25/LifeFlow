# LifeFlow
Captures the essence of blood donation saving lives

UPDATE:

If you are an On-Hit recruiter, the current application is not ready for deployment yet due to the scale of the project.
However, schemas have been made for the objects in the application, which can be found in: lifeFlow >> backend >> models.

Please do view my work there to evaluate my technical knowledge, and my prowess in software development.

Integration with REST API, MongoDB & Firebase for Authentication is going to be developed.

Thank you for your consideration.
